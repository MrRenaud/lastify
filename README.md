Convert Last.fm exports to spotify playlist.

-------

If you have been using Last.fm for a while, you probably tagged a lot of songs. And if you are not lucky enough to still have Last.fm streaming in your country, you may end up with a lot of useless playlists that you can't listen to. This piece of code lets you take an export file from Last.fm and look for the songs on spotify so that you can enjoy your great playlist again.

You can give it a try on [lastify.audio](http://lastify.audio).
